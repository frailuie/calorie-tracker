# calorie-tracker
simple calorie tracker made after following freecodecamp's tutorial lesson

**i** added:
> - food/exercise icons
> - weight tracker
> - line graph to show weight loss projection

 what i **want to change** for the next food journal project:
 > - layout/design
> - the line graph entirely
